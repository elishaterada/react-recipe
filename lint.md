# Add ESLint to your project

Use [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) which includes plugins for Import, React, and a11y.

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```

It's best to complete this step early on in the project so you don't have to fix errors later.
